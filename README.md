Instructions to get my macOS installation ready for coding. I often rebuild my machine and this is to document the steps in installing tools and applications with the aim of eventually scripting all the steps.

**Command Line Tools for Xcode**

Installs `git` and other useful tools.

```
xcode-select --install
```

**Mozilla Firefox**

Has useful development tools like multi-account containers.

```
